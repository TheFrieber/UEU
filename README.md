Unlimited Elytra Upgraded Source Code

WARNING: This is not beginner friendly, if you search for a Soruce Code to look at, i wouldn't 
recommend this at all, get cleaner code, that has better readable code, something that has comments.

WARNING 2: Since this project was based on another project, you are also required (according to the GPLv2 statements)
to use GPLv2 on yours. Unless there are exceptions, Read GPLv2 to learn more.

Since i don't know how to use gradlew or even don't know what it is, i just send the workspace i think? 
Dunno, it's just basic code that i wrote based on the code from Unlimited Elytra v1 <-- v2 is out, open sourced. 
Just so, i didn't code in mind at all, so the code is a hell of mess, thrown the codes in and hoped for work "literally".

I don't support anything related to the Source Code, nor i help you to get the Source code working in any IDA.
So coder experience should be in you(i think).

Wroten in jre1.8.0, forgot what Spigot i used, should work for the new versions of Minecraft too.

And for those who are annoyed by my { }'s, i am annoyed of yours, can't take those half opend.. yk what i mean.

Have fun, with what ever makes fun of this ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
